        Was born on 22 December 1960, in Brooklyn, New York. 
        <span>His father, Gérard, was born in Port au Prince, Haiti, and his mother Matilde was a New York-native of Puerto Rican descent.</span>
        In this multicultural home, the artist grew up speaking Spanish, French and English.

        <p>At eight-years-old, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street and suffered a broken arm and severe internal injuries. 
          <span>While he was recuperating, his mother brought him a copy of the foundational medical textbook Gray’s Anatomy.</span>
          The volume’s detailed anatomical drawings were eye opening to the young artist.

        <p>His father threw him out of the house when he dropped out of school at the age of seventeen. 
          <span>The teenager scraped by – selling sweatshirts and postcards marked with his drawings, panhandling and crashing with friends.</span>
          His impoverished diet consisted primarily of copious amounts of cheap red wine and 15¢ bags of Cheetos.

            By adorning black male figures, including athletes, musicians and writers, with the crown, 
            Basquiat raised these historically disenfranchised artists to royal even saintly stature.
