        <span>His father, Gérard, was born in Port au Prince, Haiti, and his mother Matilde was a New York-native of Puerto Rican descent.</span>
        In this multicultural home, the artist grew up speaking Spanish, French and English.

        <p>At eight-years-old, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street and suffered a broken arm and severe internal injuries. 
          <span>While he was recuperating, his mother brought him a copy of the foundational medical textbook Gray’s Anatomy.</span>
          The volume’s detailed anatomical drawings were eye opening to the young artist.

          <span>The teenager scraped by – selling sweatshirts and postcards marked with his drawings, panhandling and crashing with friends.</span>
          His impoverished diet consisted primarily of copious amounts of cheap red wine and 15¢ bags of Cheetos.

            By adorning black male figures, including athletes, musicians and writers, with the crown, 
            Basquiat raised these historically disenfranchised artists to royal even saintly stature.

        Swiss dealer Bruno Bischofberger later suggested the two collaborate on a series of paintings,

        Basquiat created <em>SAMO</em> with his friend Al Diaz while the pair were in high school and the tag,which often featured the copyright symbol, 
        cropped up on buildings throughout lower Manhattan and Brooklyn between 1977 and 1980. 
      <em>"It was supposed to be a logo, like Pepsi.”</em> <span>Basquiat later told writer Anthony Haden-Guest.</span></p>

      <p>The end of the collaboration was announced in 1980 through a slue of tags declaring, “SAMO is dead.”</p>
